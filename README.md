Here are some common Git Bash and Unix commands you might use:

git: The primary command for interacting with Git version control. It includes subcommands like git init, git clone, git add, git commit, git push, and many more for managing your Git repositories.

ls: List files and directories in the current directory.

cd: Change the current working directory.

pwd: Print the current working directory.

mkdir: Create a new directory.

touch: Create an empty file or update the timestamp of an existing file.

rm: Remove files or directories. Use with caution, as it permanently deletes files.

mv: Move or rename files and directories.

cp: Copy files and directories.

cat: Display the contents of a file.

more or less: Display file contents one screen at a time, allowing you to scroll through long files.

grep: Search for text patterns in files using regular expressions.

echo: Print text to the terminal.

clear or Ctrl+L: Clear the terminal screen.

chmod: Change file permissions.

ssh: Secure Shell for connecting to remote servers securely.

scp: Securely copy files between local and remote systems over SSH.

curl or wget: Download files from the internet.

tar: Create or extract compressed archive files.

alias: Create custom command shortcuts.

These are just some of the common commands you might encounter when using Git Bash or any Unix-like terminal. You can use the man command followed by the command name to get detailed information and documentation on how to use a specific command. For example, man git will display the Git manual, and man ls will show the manual for the ls command.
